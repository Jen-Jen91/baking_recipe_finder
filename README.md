# Baking Recipe Finder

### Web application in React with Spring/Java back end
*Create a web app to allow users to look up baking recipes based on the ingredients they have at home*

### MVP

Users must be able to: 
* Enter ingredients they have/want to use and find a list of recipes which include these ingredients
* Click on a recipe to view full details

Create a small recipe API for testing purposes

Display photos for each recipe

Show how many of the ingredients searched are included in the recipe, and how many more ingredients are needed

### Extensions
* Allow users to filter their search (i.e. show recipes that contain **only** these ingredients and no others)
* Allow users to rate recipes
* Allow users to save their favourite recipes
* Access a detailed online recipe API
