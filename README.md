# Baking Recipe Finder

For this solo project, I created a full-stack web app that allows users to search for baking recipes based on the ingredients they have at home. A small API of recipes was created using Java and Spring, and the front-end was formed with React JS.

### To run the app:

1) Back-end:
    * Run the 'RecipesApplication' file in IntelliJ (keep this running)
    * View the API on http://localhost:8080/
2) Front-end:
    * In the terminal, enter *npm start* (keep this running)
    * View the app on http://localhost:3000






### Brief for the project:

#### MVP

Users must be able to: 
* Enter ingredients they have/want to use and find a list of recipes which include these ingredients
* Click on a recipe to view full details

Create a small recipe API for testing purposes

Display photos for each recipe

Show how many of the ingredients searched are included in the recipe, and how many more ingredients are needed

#### Extensions
* Allow users to filter their search (i.e. show recipes that contain **only** these ingredients and no others)
* Allow users to rate recipes
* Allow users to save their favourite recipes
* Access a detailed online recipe API
